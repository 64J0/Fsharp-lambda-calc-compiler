# Fang - Functional Language

* Goal: Create a language based on lambda calculus using F#

In this repository I'll just store some code that I get from [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRHJ4qcFbNE&ab_channel=ArtemPyanykh) that _Artem Pyanykh_ is doing.

My personal goal is to get better with F# and also understand better how a compiler works.
