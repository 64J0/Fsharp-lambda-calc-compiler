# Fang - Functional Language

In this repository I'll just store some code that I get from [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRHJ4qcFbNE&ab_channel=ArtemPyanykh) that _Artem Pyanykh_ is doing.

My personal goal is to get better with F# and also understand better how a compiler works.

### How to run

```bash
$ dotnet run

# more performant way
$ dotnet run -c Release
```

## A bit about compilers

A *compiler* is a program that translates a source program written in some high-level programming language (such as F#) into machine code for some computer architecture (such as the Intel Pentium architecture). The generated machine code can be later executed many times against different data each time.
